            •	Please be aware that since you are transferring from your personal account to Itron’s corporate account, regardless of your existing carrier,<b> you must contact the carrier to notify them you are authorizing Itron to assume your phone number to Itron’s corporate account.</b> If this initial step is not completed, your number can not be ported over to Itron’s corporate account.  Device must be paid off/not in contract and your account must be in good standing.

            •	If there are any subscriptions that are billed to your personal phone account, those subscriptions must be canceled temporarily prior to the transfer. Please work with your carrier to determine what subscriptions (if any) and how you can cancel them temporarily. If the subscriptions are not canceled, our carriers will not be able to transfer the liability to Itron. Be forewarned that Itron does not pay for iCloud storage.   Save/download anything currently saved on your phone that you don’t want to lose.

              iii.	Note - Please be aware that if  you are transferring from the corporate account to your personal account, an authorization needs to be submitted on Itron’s end to release the line to you to take to a personal account.  When the line is released, if it is mid contract, and you are not staying with the same carrier, an early termination fee may apply.  Your manager will need to approve, releasing the number/device and paying the early termination fee.   If you plan to stay with the current carrier there is no early termination fee, just know that you will be expected to complete the contract on your personal account
